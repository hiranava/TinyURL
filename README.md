# TinyURL
A RESTful implementation of TinyURL service 

This project has three main aspects
1. it takes input a long URL and converts it to a short URL.
2. it takes a short URL and provides the original URL.
3. And a short URL can be added or removed to a blacklist.


Blacklisted URLs cannot be used to get the original URL until it is removed from the blacklist.

We have designed a simple user interface which interacts with the RESTful APIs in the backend to complete this project.
